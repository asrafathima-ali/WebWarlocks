As a part of internship project, we as a team of 5 have done a project on Full Stack Web Development:

This abstract provides an overview of the full-stack web development project undertaken for "Tech Tune Motors," a comprehensive automotive service provider. The primary objective of this project was to create a user-friendly and efficient website that allows customers to easily select various automotive services, choose appointment slots that suit their schedule, and receive confirmation emails for their bookings.
The development process began with a thorough analysis of Tech Tune Motorâ€™s requirements and goals. This analysis informed the selection of appropriate technologies and frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and Django framework, and a relational database (such as MySQL) for the back-end. Additionally, email functionality was integrated through technologies like third-party email services.
The website provides detailed information about the services offered by Tech Tune Motors, enabling users to make informed choices. Appointment scheduling was a critical component of the project. Users can browse available time slots, select a convenient date and time for their service, and submit their booking requests. Upon successful appointment booking, customers receive confirmation emails containing appointment details, service information, and contact information for any inquiries or changes.
Overall, this system not only benefits Tech Tune Motors by improving customer service but also enhances the user experience, increasing customer satisfaction and engagement.
